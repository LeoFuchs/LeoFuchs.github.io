## Data Science Projects Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of data science projects that I developed during my studies to explore machine learning algorithms and certain data analysis.

### Classification Problems

#### [Predicting Credit Card Approvals:](https://github.com/LeoFuchs/LeoFuchs.github.io/blob/master/projects/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals/notebook.ipynb)

We'll use the [Credit Card Approval Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook, based in a project from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/558), is as follows:

- First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset;
- We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries;
- We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
- After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
- Finally, we will build some machine learning models that can predict if an individual application for a credit card will be accepted.

### Markdown

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LeoFuchs/LeoFuchs.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LeoFuchs/LeoFuchs.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
