# Data Science Projects Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of data science projects that I developed during my studies to explore machine learning algorithms and certain data analysis.

## **Classification Problems**

### 1. [Predicting Credit Card Approvals:](https://github.com/LeoFuchs/LeoFuchs.github.io/blob/master/projects/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals/notebook.ipynb)

We'll use the [Credit Card Approval Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook, based in a project from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/558), is as follows:

- First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset;
- We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries;
- We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
- After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
- Finally, we will build some machine learning models that can predict if an individual application for a credit card will be accepted or no.
